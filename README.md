#  Netflix Data Cleaning & Exploration

**Data Cleaning & Python Fundamentals Project**

Welcome! 
This project focuses on **cleaning and exploring a Netflix dataset** to prepare it for further analysis. It's designed as an **introductory data science project**, helping build confidence with Python, data preprocessing, and basic data visualization.



##  About This Project

Real-world data is rarely clean. Before any meaningful analysis can happen, datasets must be inspected, cleaned, and understood.

##  Dataset

**Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization (Kaggle)**

The dataset includes information about Netflix titles such as:

* Movies and TV shows
* Release years
* Genres
* Countries
* Ratings and durations


### Tools & Libraries

* Python 
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (basic visualizations)
* Jupyter Notebook


##  Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Loading & Exploration

* Set up a Google Colab notebook
* Load the CSV file
* Inspect the dataset structure
* Understand different data types

### Milestone 2: Data Cleaning

* Identify and handle null values
* Clean and format columns
* Learn how data objects work in Python
* Prepare the dataset for analysis



##  Deliverables

* 📓 **Interactive Python notebook** (Blank and fimshed version)
